Depend- ing on the ways of our understanding and capacities of accepting the “unfamiliar,” we comprehend and legitimize what is to be considered as real. Brian Massumi is perceptive to this in a multifaceted way, by comparing Baudrillard’s interpretation of the reality-simulation, in which there is no division between the real and the virtual, with Deleuze and Guattari’s negation of the linear approach to the real. Such a non-lin- ear approach to reality is supported by the vanishing of boundaries, and the influence of the virtual on the real.',\n",
